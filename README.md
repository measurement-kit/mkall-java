# Measurement Kit Java JNI bindings

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️: This repository is now unused. All the relevant changes have
been integrated into measurement-kit/android-libs.

This is experimental code, use at your own risk. We mainly use this code
to more easily debug JNI issues on Android. Our focus is Android.

You need to compile MK >= 0.9.0-beta with:

```
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-shared
make install
```

Then you can run the scripts in the script folder in sequence.
